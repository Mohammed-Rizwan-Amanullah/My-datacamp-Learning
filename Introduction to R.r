# As part of the datacamp "Introduction to R" I have learned the below topics
# - Intro to basics
# - Vectors
# - Matrices
# - Factors
# - Data Frames
# - Lists

#---------------# INTRO TO BAISCS -----------------------

## Arithmetic with R

# Calculate 3 + 4
3 + 4

# Calculate 6 + 12
6+12

# An addition
5 + 5

# A subtraction
5 - 5

# A multiplication
3 * 5

 # A division
(5 + 5) / 2

# Exponentiation
2^5

# Modulo
28%%6

## Variable Assignment

# Assign the value 42 to x
x <- 42

# Print out the value of the variable x
x

# Assign the value 5 to the variable my_apples
my_apples <- 5

# Print out the value of the variable my_apples
my_apples

# Assign a value to the variables my_apples and my_oranges
my_apples <- 5
my_oranges <- 6


# Add these two variables together
my_apples+my_oranges

# Create the variable my_fruit
my_fruit <- my_apples+my_oranges

# Assign a value to the variable my_apples
my_apples <- 5

# Fix the assignment of my_oranges
my_oranges <- 6

# Create the variable my_fruit and print it out
my_fruit <- my_apples + my_oranges
my_fruit

## Basic datatype in R
#Decimal values like 4.5 are called numerics.
#Whole numbers like 4 are called integers. Integers are also numerics.
#Boolean values (TRUE or FALSE) are called logical.
#Text (or string) values are called characters.

# Change my_numeric to be 42
my_numeric <- 42

# Change my_character to be "universe"
my_character <- "universe"

# Change my_logical to be FALSE
my_logical <- FALSE

# Declare variables of different types
my_numeric <- 42
my_character <- "universe"
my_logical <- FALSE

# Check class of my_numeric
class(my_numeric)

# Check class of my_character
class(my_character)

# Check class of my_logical
class(my_logical)

#---------------- Vectors --------------------
#a vector is a simple tool to store data.
#For example, you can store your daily gains and losses in the casinos.
#In R, you create a vector with the combine function c().
#You place the vector elements separated by a comma between the parentheses.

## Vector Assignment
numeric_vector <- c(1, 10, 49)
character_vector <- c("a", "b", "c")

# Complete the code for boolean_vector
boolean_vector <- c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)

# Poker winnings from Monday to Friday
poker_vector <- c(140, -50, 20, -120, 240)

# Roulette winnings from Monday to Friday
roulette_vector <-  c(-24, -50, 100, -350, 10)

## Naming a vector
#You can give a name to the elements of a vector with the names() function.
# Poker winnings from Monday to Friday
poker_vector <- c(140, -50, 20, -120, 240)

# Roulette winnings from Monday to Friday
roulette_vector <- c(-24, -50, 100, -350, 10)

# Assign days as names of poker_vector
names(poker_vector) <- c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday")

# Assign days as names of roulette_vector
# Assign days as names of roulette_vector
names(roulette_vector) <- c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday")

## another way of naming a vector
# Poker winnings from Monday to Friday
poker_vector <- c(140, -50, 20, -120, 240)

# Roulette winnings from Monday to Friday
roulette_vector <- c(-24, -50, 100, -350, 10)

# The variable days_vector
days_vector <- c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday")

# Assign the names of the day to roulette_vector and poker_vector
names(poker_vector) <-   days_vector
names(roulette_vector) <- days_vector

A_vector <- c(1, 2, 3)
B_vector <- c(4, 5, 6)

# Take the sum of A_vector and B_vector
total_vector <- A_vector + B_vector

# Print out total_vector
total_vector

# Poker and roulette winnings from Monday to Friday:
poker_vector <- c(140, -50, 20, -120, 240)
roulette_vector <- c(-24, -50, 100, -350, 10)
days_vector <- c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday")
names(poker_vector) <- days_vector
names(roulette_vector) <- days_vector

# Assign to total_daily how much you won/lost on each day
total_daily <- poker_vector + roulette_vector
total_daily

# Poker and roulette winnings from Monday to Friday:
poker_vector <- c(140, -50, 20, -120, 240)
roulette_vector <- c(-24, -50, 100, -350, 10)
days_vector <- c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday")
names(poker_vector) <- days_vector
names(roulette_vector) <- days_vector

# Total winnings with poker
total_poker <- sum(poker_vector)

# Total winnings with roulette
total_roulette <-  sum(roulette_vector)

# Total winnings overall
total_week <- total_poker + total_roulette

# Print out total_week
  total_week

###
#Calculate total_poker and total_roulette as in the previous exercise.
#Use the sum() function twice.
#Check if your total gains in poker are higher than for roulette by using a comparison.
#Simply print out the result of this comparison.
#What do you conclude, should you focus on roulette or on poker?
# Poker and roulette winnings from Monday to Friday:
poker_vector <- c(140, -50, 20, -120, 240)
roulette_vector <- c(-24, -50, 100, -350, 10)
days_vector <- c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday")
names(poker_vector) <- days_vector
names(roulette_vector) <- days_vector

# Calculate total gains for poker and roulette
total_poker <- sum(poker_vector)
total_roulette <- sum(roulette_vector)

# Check if you realized higher total gains in poker than in roulette
total_poker > total_roulette


## Vector Selection
#To select elements of a vector (and later matrices, data frames, â€¦),
#you can use square brackets. Between the square brackets,
#you indicate what elements to select.
# Poker and roulette winnings from Monday to Friday:
poker_vector <- c(140, -50, 20, -120, 240)
roulette_vector <- c(-24, -50, 100, -350, 10)
days_vector <- c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday")
names(poker_vector) <- days_vector
names(roulette_vector) <- days_vector

# Define a new variable based on a selection
poker_wednesday <- poker_vector[3]

##
#To select multiple elements from a vector,
#you can add square brackets at the end of it.
#You can indicate between the brackets what elements should be selected.
# Define a new variable based on a selection
poker_midweek <- poker_vector[c(2, 3, 4)]

##
#an easier way to do this: c(2, 3, 4) can be abbreviated to2:4,
#which generates a vector with all natural numbers from 2 up to 4.
# Define a new variable based on a selection
roulette_selection_vector <- roulette_vector[2:5]

# Select poker results for Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday
poker_start <- poker_vector[c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday")]

# Calculate the average of the elements in poker_start
mean(poker_start)

## Selection by comparison

c(4, 5, 6) > 5
[1] FALSE FALSE TRUE

# Which days did you make money on poker?
selection_vector <- poker_vector > 0

# Print out selection_vector
selection_vector

# Which days did you make money on poker?
selection_vector <- poker_vector > 0
selection_vector

# Select from poker_vector these days
poker_winning_days <- poker_vector[selection_vector]
poker_winning_days

# Which days did you make money on roulette?
selection_vector <- roulette_vector > 0
selection_vector

# Select from roulette_vector these days
roulette_winning_days <- roulette_vector[selection_vector]
roulette_winning_days


#------------ Matrix -----------------------
# In R, a matrix is a collection of elements of the same data type
#(numeric, character, or logical) arranged into a fixed number of rows and columns.
#Since you are only working with rows and columns, a matrix is called two-dimensional.

# Construct a matrix with 3 rows that contain the numbers 1 up to 9
mat <- matrix(1:9, byrow = TRUE, nrow=3)
mat

# Box office Star Wars (in millions!)
new_hope <- c(460.998, 314.4)
empire_strikes <- c(290.475, 247.900)
return_jedi <- c(309.306, 165.8)

# Create box_office
box_office <- c(new_hope, empire_strikes, return_jedi)
box_office

# Construct star_wars_matrix
star_wars_matrix <- matrix(box_office, byrow=TRUE, nrow=3)
star_wars_matrix

## Naming a Matrix
# rownames(my_matrix) <- row_names_vector
# colnames(my_matrix) <- col_names_vector
# Box office Star Wars (in millions!)
new_hope <- c(460.998, 314.4)
empire_strikes <- c(290.475, 247.900)
return_jedi <- c(309.306, 165.8)

# Construct matrix
star_wars_matrix <- matrix(c(new_hope, empire_strikes, return_jedi), nrow = 3, byrow = TRUE)

# Vectors region and titles, used for naming
region <- c("US", "non-US")
titles <- c("A New Hope", "The Empire Strikes Back", "Return of the Jedi")

# Name the columns with region
colnames(star_wars_matrix) <- region

# Name the rows with titles
rownames(star_wars_matrix) <- titles

# Print out star_wars_matrix
star_wars_matrix

#In R, the function rowSums() conveniently calculates the totals for each row of a matrix.
#This function creates a new vector:
#Calculate worldwide box office figures
worldwide_vector <- rowSums(star_wars_matrix)
worldwide_vector

## selection of matrix elements
# similar to vectors, we can use [] to select one or multiple elements from a matrix
#my_matrix[1,2] selects the element at the first row and second column.
#my_matrix[1:3,2:4] results in a matrix with the
#data on the rows 1, 2, 3 and columns 2, 3, 4.
#my_matrix[,1] selects all elements of the first column.
#my_matrix[1,] selects all elements of the first row.

# all_wars_matrix is available in your workspace
all_wars_matrix

# Select the non-US revenue for all movies
non_us_all <- all_wars_matrix[,2]
non_us_all
# Average non-US revenue
mean(non_us_all)

# Select the non-US revenue for first two movies
non_us_some <- all_wars_matrix[1:2,2]

# Average non-US revenue for first two movies
mean(non_us_some)

## A little arithmetic with matrices
#Similar to what you have learned with vectors,
#the standard operators like +, -, /, *, etc.
#work in an element-wise way on matrices in R.

#Question
#find out how many visitors went to each movie for each geographical area.
#You already have the total revenue figures in all_wars_matrix.
#Assume that the price of a ticket was 5 dollars.

#------------------ Factors ------------------------
#The term factor refers to a statistical data type used to store categorical variables.
#The difference between a categorical variable and a continuous variable
#is that a categorical variable can belong to a limited number of categories.
#A continuous variable, on the other hand, can correspond to an infinite number of values.
# to create a factor, we need to have a vector containing categories for all observations

# sex observations for 5 individuals
sex_vector <- c("Male","Female","Female","Male","Male")

# factor() function will encode the vector as factor
factor_sex_vector <- factor(sex_vector)

# Print out factor_sex_vector
factor_sex_vector
> Levels: Female Male

### Two types of categorical variable
# Nominal Categorical - variable without implied order
# - impossible to say one is worth more than the other
# Ordinal categorical - variables have natural ordering
# - example low, medium, high
# Animals
animals_vector <- c("Elephant", "Giraffe", "Donkey", "Horse")
factor_animals_vector <- factor(animals_vector)
factor_animals_vector

# Temperature
temperature_vector <- c("High", "Low", "High","Low", "Medium")
factor_temperature_vector <- factor(temperature_vector, order = TRUE, levels = c("Low", "Medium", "High"))
factor_temperature_vector

## Factor levels()
# sometimes, we need to change the factor name for clarity.
# example - changing sex "M" and "F" to "Male" and "Female"
# levels(factor_vector) <- c("name1", "name2",...)

# NOTE - R assign's value alphabetically, so use c() to assign them
# based on the output of the factor
# Code to build factor_survey_vector
survey_vector <- c("M", "F", "F", "M", "M")
factor_survey_vector <- factor(survey_vector)
factor_survey_vector

# Specify the levels of factor_survey_vector
levels(factor_survey_vector) <- c("Female", "Male")

factor_survey_vector

## summary() function

# Generate summary for factor_survey_vector
summary(factor_survey_vector)

Female   Male
     2      3

#By default, R returns NA when you try to compare values in a factor,
#since the idea doesn't make sense
