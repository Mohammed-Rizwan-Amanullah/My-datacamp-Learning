# As part of the datacamp "Introduction to R" I have learned the below topics
# - Intro to basics
# - Vectors
# - Matrices
# - Factors
# - Data Frames
# - Lists

#---------------# INTRO TO BAISCS -----------------------

## Arithmetic with R

# Calculate 3 + 4
3 + 4

# Calculate 6 + 12
6+12

# An addition
5 + 5

# A subtraction
5 - 5

# A multiplication
3 * 5

 # A division
(5 + 5) / 2

# Exponentiation
2^5

# Modulo
28%%6

## Variable Assignment

# Assign the value 42 to x
x <- 42

# Print out the value of the variable x
x

# Assign the value 5 to the variable my_apples
my_apples <- 5

# Print out the value of the variable my_apples
my_apples

# Assign a value to the variables my_apples and my_oranges
my_apples <- 5
my_oranges <- 6


# Add these two variables together
my_apples+my_oranges

# Create the variable my_fruit
my_fruit <- my_apples+my_oranges

# Assign a value to the variable my_apples
my_apples <- 5

# Fix the assignment of my_oranges
my_oranges <- 6

# Create the variable my_fruit and print it out
my_fruit <- my_apples + my_oranges
my_fruit

## Basic datatype in R
#Decimal values like 4.5 are called numerics.
#Whole numbers like 4 are called integers. Integers are also numerics.
#Boolean values (TRUE or FALSE) are called logical.
#Text (or string) values are called characters.

# Change my_numeric to be 42
my_numeric <- 42

# Change my_character to be "universe"
my_character <- "universe"

# Change my_logical to be FALSE
my_logical <- FALSE

# Declare variables of different types
my_numeric <- 42
my_character <- "universe"
my_logical <- FALSE

# Check class of my_numeric
class(my_numeric)

# Check class of my_character
class(my_character)

# Check class of my_logical
class(my_logical)

#---------------- Vectors --------------------
#a vector is a simple tool to store data.
#For example, you can store your daily gains and losses in the casinos.
#In R, you create a vector with the combine function c().
#You place the vector elements separated by a comma between the parentheses.

## Vector Assignment
numeric_vector <- c(1, 10, 49)
character_vector <- c("a", "b", "c")

# Complete the code for boolean_vector
boolean_vector <- c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)

# Poker winnings from Monday to Friday
poker_vector <- c(140, -50, 20, -120, 240)

# Roulette winnings from Monday to Friday
roulette_vector <-  c(-24, -50, 100, -350, 10)

## Naming a vector
#You can give a name to the elements of a vector with the names() function.
# Poker winnings from Monday to Friday
poker_vector <- c(140, -50, 20, -120, 240)

# Roulette winnings from Monday to Friday
roulette_vector <- c(-24, -50, 100, -350, 10)

# Assign days as names of poker_vector
names(poker_vector) <- c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday")

# Assign days as names of roulette_vector
# Assign days as names of roulette_vector
names(roulette_vector) <- c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday")

## another way of naming a vector
# Poker winnings from Monday to Friday
poker_vector <- c(140, -50, 20, -120, 240)

# Roulette winnings from Monday to Friday
roulette_vector <- c(-24, -50, 100, -350, 10)

# The variable days_vector
days_vector <- c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday")

# Assign the names of the day to roulette_vector and poker_vector
names(poker_vector) <-   days_vector
names(roulette_vector) <- days_vector

A_vector <- c(1, 2, 3)
B_vector <- c(4, 5, 6)

# Take the sum of A_vector and B_vector
total_vector <- A_vector + B_vector

# Print out total_vector
total_vector

# Poker and roulette winnings from Monday to Friday:
poker_vector <- c(140, -50, 20, -120, 240)
roulette_vector <- c(-24, -50, 100, -350, 10)
days_vector <- c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday")
names(poker_vector) <- days_vector
names(roulette_vector) <- days_vector

# Assign to total_daily how much you won/lost on each day
total_daily <- poker_vector + roulette_vector
total_daily

# Poker and roulette winnings from Monday to Friday:
poker_vector <- c(140, -50, 20, -120, 240)
roulette_vector <- c(-24, -50, 100, -350, 10)
days_vector <- c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday")
names(poker_vector) <- days_vector
names(roulette_vector) <- days_vector

# Total winnings with poker
total_poker <- sum(poker_vector)

# Total winnings with roulette
total_roulette <-  sum(roulette_vector)

# Total winnings overall
total_week <- total_poker + total_roulette

# Print out total_week
  total_week

###
#Calculate total_poker and total_roulette as in the previous exercise.
#Use the sum() function twice.
#Check if your total gains in poker are higher than for roulette by using a comparison.
#Simply print out the result of this comparison.
#What do you conclude, should you focus on roulette or on poker?
# Poker and roulette winnings from Monday to Friday:
poker_vector <- c(140, -50, 20, -120, 240)
roulette_vector <- c(-24, -50, 100, -350, 10)
days_vector <- c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday")
names(poker_vector) <- days_vector
names(roulette_vector) <- days_vector

# Calculate total gains for poker and roulette
total_poker <- sum(poker_vector)
total_roulette <- sum(roulette_vector)

# Check if you realized higher total gains in poker than in roulette
total_poker > total_roulette


## Vector Selection
#To select elements of a vector (and later matrices, data frames, â€¦),
#you can use square brackets. Between the square brackets,
#you indicate what elements to select.
# Poker and roulette winnings from Monday to Friday:
poker_vector <- c(140, -50, 20, -120, 240)
roulette_vector <- c(-24, -50, 100, -350, 10)
days_vector <- c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday")
names(poker_vector) <- days_vector
names(roulette_vector) <- days_vector

# Define a new variable based on a selection
poker_wednesday <- poker_vector[3]

##
#To select multiple elements from a vector,
#you can add square brackets at the end of it.
#You can indicate between the brackets what elements should be selected.
# Define a new variable based on a selection
poker_midweek <- poker_vector[c(2, 3, 4)]

##
#an easier way to do this: c(2, 3, 4) can be abbreviated to2:4,
#which generates a vector with all natural numbers from 2 up to 4.
# Define a new variable based on a selection
roulette_selection_vector <- roulette_vector[2:5]
